# A-Visual-Analysis-of-Greenhouse-Gas-Trends-and-Green-Bond-Financing

### 📚 Project Overview

This project explores the persistent rise in global greenhouse gas emissions despite significant growth in climate-related financial instruments like green bonds. Using comprehensive datasets from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Climate Data Portal, we analyze trends across emissions, green bond financing, and surface temperature changes to uncover the gap between financial investments and real-world environmental outcomes.

Our work includes interactive visualizations (created in Tableau), a detailed data story, and a full project report that highlights sectoral and regional emission patterns, the rise of green bonds, and the impact of global events like COVID-19 on climate indicators.

### 🎯 Objectives

Identify major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions by sector and region.
Track changes in emissions trends from 2010 to 2022 across continents and industries.
Analyze the growth and distribution of green bond financing from 1985 to 2022.
Assess the relationship between climate finance efforts and actual changes in emissions and surface temperatures.

### 🔑 Key Insights

Emissions continue to rise, especially in the energy and manufacturing sectors, despite an increase in green bond financing.
Asia stands out as the leading emitter, driven by industrial and energy sector growth.
Green bond issuance has accelerated in recent years but shows limited direct impact on reversing emission trends, raising concerns about greenwashing.
Surface temperature patterns suggest temporary dips (e.g., during COVID-19 lockdowns) do not lead to sustained climate improvements without systemic action.

### 📌 Limitations

Some countries and regions (especially in South America) are underrepresented in the datasets.
Incomplete or missing green bond reporting data limits comprehensive financial analysis.
